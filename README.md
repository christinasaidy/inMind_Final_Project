# Smart Receipt Assistant

Smart Receipt Assistant is a multi-agent system designed to extract, normalize, store and query information from retail receipts.  It combines an orchestrator (Complex LangGraph) with a remote A2A agent (ADK Agent) 
to perform OCR on receipt images, convert currencies, translate text and provide relevant information from external knowledge bases. The project also exposes a FastAPI backend and a Gradio front-end for end-user interaction.
